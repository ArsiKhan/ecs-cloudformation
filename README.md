# Deploy containers using Elastic Container Service and CloudFormation

The templates in this repo are best suited for a basic web architecture of an application with a frontend and backend service.

To use these templates launch a cluster template for the launch type and networking stack that you want. Then launch a service template for each service you want to run in the cluster. When launching a service template its important to make sure the "StackName" value is filled in with the same name that you selected for the name of your cluster stack.

Each of the service stacks has default values prefilled for launching a simple Nginx container, but can be adjusted to launch your own container.
